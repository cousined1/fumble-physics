## Reddit: r/NFL

**Title:**
```
I made a free browser game for Super Bowl Sunday - catch fumbling footballs while gravity flips. Chiefs balls are faster, Eagles balls bounce higher.
```

**Body:**
```
Built this over the weekend for the big game.

**Fumble Physics** - tap to catch footballs before they escape. The twist: gravity randomly flips and your reflexes get tested.

🔴 Chiefs balls = faster, harder to catch
🟢 Eagles balls = bouncier, unpredictable
🔥 Combo multipliers for streaks
📱 Works on phone or desktop

**Title:**
```
Made a Super Bowl game where Chiefs footballs are faster (and harder to catch). Can you break 5k?
```

**Body:**
```
Quick browser game I threw together for Sunday.

Catch the fumbled footballs before they escape — but gravity flips every few seconds.

🔴 Chiefs balls are FAST
🟢 Eagles balls just bounce around like confused birds

Browser game for the big game this Sunday.

Tap to catch fumbled footballs. The catch: gravity flips randomly.

🟢 Eagles balls bounce higher (just like our spirits)
🔴 Chiefs balls are faster (compensating for something?)

Built a dumb little game for Super Bowl weekend 🏈

Catch the footballs. Easy right?

Except gravity flips every few seconds.

🔴 Chiefs balls = faster
🟢 Eagles balls = bouncier

```
The game gets harder over time:
- Balls spawn faster
- Gravity flips more often  
- Miss a catch = combo resets

Built it in a day with Matter.js

No ads, no signup, just vibes

If you break 10,000 points screenshot or it didn't happen

Happy Super Bowl weekend 🏈

## Optional: Hacker News

**Title:**
```
Show HN: Fumble Physics – A Super Bowl browser game with flipping gravity
```

**Body:**
```
Built a quick physics game for Super Bowl weekend using Matter.js.

The premise: catch footballs before they escape the screen. The twist: gravity flips every few seconds.

Chiefs (red) balls move faster, Eagles (green) balls bounce higher. Simple mechanics but gets chaotic quickly.

Tech: vanilla HTML/JS + Matter.js for physics. No framework, no build step. Single index.html file.
